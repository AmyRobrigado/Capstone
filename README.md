Hello, my name is Amy Robrigado and this is my e-commerce website. The site is themed around my work as an online artist/streamer where I sell prints of my work and offer custom commissions.

The pieces of HTML that turned out great were my print cards and my nav tabs holding sign-in/ sign-out sheets.

The print cards were straight forward to code and I even went to add a select menu for print sizes and an add cart button. Though there were several issues with the spacing and even sizing, it turned out better than I anticipated. 

The nav tabs for my sign-in/ sign-out sheets had slight issues as it was my first time implementing them, but in the end they turned out looking great and functional.
